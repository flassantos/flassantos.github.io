Hi! I am Flávia, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics program at the  University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. I am advised by [Renata Pontin de Mattos Fortes](https://sites.icmc.usp.br/renata/) and co-advised by [Sandra Gama](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/sandra.gama/). I do research on Human-Computer Interaction, more precisely on usability inspection and accessibility assessment.

I did my Master's in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São Paulo (USP). My [dissertation](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-12112018-163133/en.php) was advised by Renata P. M. Fortes, in which we proposed a specialized cognitive walkthrough method to evaluate digital games by taking into account older users.
